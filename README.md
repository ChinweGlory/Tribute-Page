# Tribute-Page
This tribute is all about the people in my life that i love so much but they are not here again.
# Approach
In the <body> element,In title of the page I will use the h1 tag after that I will add an image with a caption. I will create another div tag and write all the contents (using p tags).
I have also given an ID for each tag so that I can beautify the design using the respective ID in the CSS file.
In the CSS section, I have maintained a central design and used box-shadow to create a box effect around the main content.
